## Idea
The TRaCE (Transparent Records and Commodity Exchange) protocol uniquely identifies each product marketed on our platform, linking it to its digital NFT counterpart. This ensures transparency and traceability throughout the product's lifecycle over the blockchain. By anchoring NFTs to real-world assets, we give them tangible value equal to the asset's real-world value, making them a reliable medium of transaction. Our protocol offers users a trustworthy and efficient way to engage in commodity exchange, surpassing the limitations of static posts in existing markets![image](https://github.com/Deflated-Pappadam/deflated-pappadam/assets/100425953/eda9eec5-340b-45fe-bddf-8ecbbc81d119)
